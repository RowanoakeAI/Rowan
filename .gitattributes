# Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization
# This setting tells Git to automatically detect text files and normalize line endings
# - text=auto will convert line endings to LF (Linux/Unix style) when storing in repo
# - On checkout, files will be converted to the OS's native line endings
* text=auto
